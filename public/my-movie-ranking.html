<h1>The Best Movies According to Oziel</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of The Rings Trilogy</h3>
    <p>These are my favorite movies of all time. <br />
They are obviously a trilogy but I count them as one because the whole story cannot be told in just one movie. <br />
I love this fantasy and these movies, in my opinion, are some of the best. <br />
</p>

<h3>Kill Bill Vol. 1 & Vol. 2</h3>
    <p>Again, these movies are counted as one for the same reason. <br />
I've always loved a good action movie and these perfectly fit the bill. (Get it? Fit the "bill"?) <br />
Although, in full disclosure, these movies are not for the faint of heart. <br />
I say this because these movies are very gory. <br />
</p>

<h3>Cowboy Bebop</h3>
    <p>Now, this one is an anime. "Japanese animation." <br />
        I love this one because of the action as well. <br />
        It does include a bit of a love story, so that adds a bit of emotion to it. <br />
