<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a 15 year veteran as a firefighter/paramedic for the city of Laredo.
  I have worked with a private ambulance company as well as a paramedic.  I enjoy spending with my family on my days off. 
  I am a happily married father of 3. My family is my driving motivation for improving myself and trying to get ahead in life.</p>

<p>I collect rare coins and any money with errors on them. I play video games as well. Currently I play Fortnite with friends 
  but I do enjoy solo action and adventure games. As you can see in my "Movie Ranking Project", I enjoy different genres of
  movies. I recently got into playing pickleball.</p>

<p>I aspire to become a great Web Developer. I would love to expand my imagination and creativity.</p>
